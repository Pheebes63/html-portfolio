<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Ian Pebbles. I am now happily retired having worked for the same company for 44 years,
  two months and 20 days. I was in marketing (Product Management) for over 25 years. My responsibilities
  included setting the direction for my product, evolving the product into one of the best in the market and
  driving more than Â£1000m of profitable revenue each year. </p>

<p>I retired on 31 October 2023; I have yet to establish a new routine. I have extensive PC and relevant application
  knowledge. Moreover, I am a little familiar with HTML, CSS and Javascript, but far from accomplished. I
  wanted to complete this course to refine my HTML skills, and to eliminate any bad habits, which may have
  crept in.</p>

<p>Who knows? This may be a skill I can potentially seek to monetise in retirement.</p>
<p>My sincere thanks to Angela Yu; you are a great tutor.</p>
